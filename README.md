# Bloging Community
The objective of this project is to develop a dynamic community blog platform using Django, Python, HTML, and CSS, with a focus on physics-related content. This platform will allow users to register, log in, and contribute community-related articles, discussions, and resources. The project will implement full CRUD functionality, enabling users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their own posts and comments. Additionally, an admin interface will be implemented to manage user accounts and monitor content for adherence to community guidelines.

Key Features and Objectives:

1. User Authentication and Authorization:
   - Implement a secure user registration and authentication system.
   - Assign different roles (regular user and admin) with distinct privileges.

2. CommU-Centric Content Management:
   - Enable users to create, edit, and delete blog posts, articles, and resources related to physics.
   - Implement a categorization system for organizing content topics.

3. Community Interaction and Engagement:
   - Enable users to comment on posts, fostering discussion and knowledge sharing.
   - Provide upvoting/downvoting mechanisms to promote quality content.

4. Admin Interface:

5. Responsive Design:
   - Create a user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS that is accessible on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

6. Search Functionality:
   - Implement a search feature to allow users to quickly find relevant content based on keywords or  topics.

7. User Profiles:
   - Allow users to customize their profiles with personal information and avatars.
   - Display user activity history, including posts, comments, and interactions.

# FUTURE PLAN
8. Notifications and Alerts:
   - Implement a notification system to inform users about new comments, replies, and other relevant updates.

9. Testing and Quality Assurance:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the platform's functionality, security, and performance.
   - Apply best practices for code quality, including unit testing and integration testing.
